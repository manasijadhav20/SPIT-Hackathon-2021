Problem Statement - Early warning system

Background: Frequent travellers suffering from various medical conditions find it difficult to keep watch on their medical routine and either miss dosages, or are
unaware of the threats that a destination weather can pose to them. We want to help them with an auto assistant that understands the upcoming travel plan
using email/sms/photo gallery information and helping the traveller about their upcoming travel needs.
